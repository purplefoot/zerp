Zerp is z-machine interpreter written in C that uses Andrew Plotkin's GLK Library for I/O. It is also
one of the few such programs not named after a spell used in Infocom's "Enchanter" series.

Zerp can just about play version 3 games at the moment, but this has not been tested in any rigorous way.

Zerp is copyright 2010 by Ian Webb. Released under a standard MIT license, but you want nothing to do
with this code - trust me.
