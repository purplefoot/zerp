=======

Zerp is z-machine interpreter written in C that uses Andrew Plotkin's GLK Library for I/O. It is also
one of the few such programs not named after a spell used in Infocom's "Enchanter" series.

Zerp can just about play version 3 games at the moment, but this has not been tested in any rigorous way.

The cheapglk, glkterm and ztools folder contain code not written by me. They retain their respective licenses.

Zerp is copyright 2010 by Ian Webb. Released under a standard MIT license, but you want nothing to do
with this code - trust me.
