Z E R P
=======

Zerp is z-machine interpreter written in C that uses Andrew Plotkin's GLK Library for I/O. It is also
one of the few such programs not named after a spell used in Infocom's "Enchanter" series.

Zerp can just about play version 3 games at the moment, but this has not been tested in any rigorous way.


To do:
=====
* Finish ZString encoding
* Complete V4/5/8 support
* Better split window support
* Fonts/colours
* Proper ZCharacter support & Unicode
* Save/Restore/Undo/Verify
* Timed input
* Input/Output Streams
* Blorb
* Sound effects
* More tests
